# Zergling Deployment Debug Log

## Issue: Cloud Deploy Release Failure
**Date:** January 2025  
**Error:** The rollout failed with deployFailureCause: RELEASE_FAILED. (Release render operation ended in failure.)  
**Release ID:** rel-b63486e5-0721-4fb3-a99b-e5272356c38a

## Debugging Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
- Cloud Deploy pipeline is failing during the render phase
- Need to test local deployment to Artifact Registry first
- Then verify Cloud Run deployment works with Zergling-specific configs

### Step 2: Local Testing Plan
1. Build container locally
2. Push to Artifact Registry manually
3. Deploy to Cloud Run manually
4. Check service account and permissions
5. Verify configurations match Terraform

### Step 3: Debugging Steps

#### 3.1 Check Current GCP Configuration
‚úÖ **Result:** Project: mainstreamwallstreet, Region: us-central1  
‚úÖ **Result:** Zergling artifact repository exists

#### 3.2 Build and Push Container
‚ùå **Issue 1:** First build created multi-platform manifest that Cloud Run doesn't support  
‚úÖ **Solution:** Built with `--platform linux/amd64`  
‚úÖ **Result:** Successfully pushed `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mainstreamwallstreet/zergling/zergling:debug-amd64-1749428531`

#### 3.3 Service Account Configuration
‚ùå **Issue 2:** Terraform defines `zergling-cloud-run` but actual SA is `cloud-run-zergling-sa`  
‚úÖ **Solution:** Used correct service account: `cloud-run-zergling-sa@mainstreamwallstreet.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

#### 3.4 Cloud Run Deployment
‚ùå **Issue 3:** Container fails to start with timeout error  
üîç **Root Cause:** Application crashes during startup with:
```
RuntimeError: Failed to initialize GCS job queue. Please check your GCS configuration.
```

#### 3.5 GCS Bucket Configuration
‚ùå **Issue 4:** Missing required GCS bucket
- Application expects `gs://zergling-data/` for:
  - Data queue: `gs://zergling-data/queue/`
  - API call logs: `gs://zergling-data/api_calls/`
- Only existing Zergling bucket is `gs://zergling-tf-state-202407/` (for Terraform state)
‚úÖ **Solution:** Created bucket subdirectories and granted storage admin permissions

#### 3.6 Application Code Fixes
‚ùå **Issue 5:** Application had Google Drive dependencies that were not needed
‚úÖ **Solution:** Removed all Google Drive folder creation code and dependencies
‚úÖ **Result:** Application now starts successfully without Google Drive requirements

#### 3.7 Final Testing
‚úÖ **Build Success:** New image `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mainstreamwallstreet/zergling/zergling:no-gdrive-1749429654`
‚úÖ **Deploy Success:** Cloud Run deployment completed successfully
‚úÖ **Health Check:** API responds with `{"status":"healthy"}`
‚úÖ **Application Logs:** Shows successful startup:
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Docker Image Issues
- Cloud Run requires single-platform amd64/linux images
- Multi-platform manifests are not supported
- **Fix:** Always build with `--platform linux/amd64`

### 2. Service Account Naming Mismatch
- Terraform config vs actual deployed SAs have different naming patterns
- Terraform: `zergling-cloud-run`
- Actual: `cloud-run-zergling-sa`
- **Action Required:** Update either Terraform or Cloud Deploy configs for consistency

### 3. Application Configuration Issues
- App crashed during startup trying to initialize GCS job queue
- Missing environment variables or credentials
- **Fix:** Set `JOB_QUEUE_BUCKET=zergling-data` and granted storage.admin permissions

### 4. Missing GCS Resources
- Required bucket `zergling-data` didn't exist
- **Fix:** Created bucket and granted permissions to Cloud Run service account
- Bucket structure created:
  - `queue/` for call schedules
  - `api_calls/` for API Ninjas request logs

### 5. Unnecessary Google Drive Dependencies
- Application had Google Drive folder management code that wasn't needed
- **Fix:** Removed all Google Drive references and folder creation logic
- Application now works without any Google Drive configuration

## Results

### ‚úÖ **APPLICATION WORKING**
- **Manual Deployment:** Successfully deployed to Cloud Run
- **Health Check:** API endpoint responds correctly
- **GCS Integration:** Job queue initializes without errors
- **Service URL:** https://zergling-api-455624753981.us-central1.run.app

### ‚ùå **Cloud Deploy Pipeline Still Failing**
- Cloud Build completes successfully
- Cloud Deploy render phase still fails
- **Status:** Application works, but CI/CD pipeline needs further debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Application is now functional** - the core issue has been resolved
2. **Cloud Deploy pipeline debugging** - needs separate investigation of:
   - Skaffold configuration
   - Cloud Deploy service configuration
   - Service account permissions for deployment
3. **Update clouddeploy/service.yaml** with correct service account reference
4. **Consider manual deployments** until Cloud Deploy pipeline is fixed
