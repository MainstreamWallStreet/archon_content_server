# Request Template

## Request Information
- **Request ID**: `REQ-2024-06-01-1200`
- **Date Created**: 2024-06-01
- **Requester**: Jane Doe
- **Status**: In Progress

## User Requirements

### Primary Request
Implement a REST API for managing customer records, including CRUD operations, file uploads for contracts, and email notifications for new entries.

### Additional Context
The API will be used by internal sales and support staff. All data must be stored securely and comply with GDPR. File uploads should be limited to PDF and image files.

## Agent Analysis & Planning

### Jobs to be Done
- Allow users to create, read, update, and delete customer records
- Enable file uploads (PDF, images) per customer
- Send email notifications when a new customer is added
- Enforce role-based access control for different user types

### Technical Approach
- Use FastAPI for API endpoints
- Store customer data in PostgreSQL
- Store files in Google Cloud Storage
- Integrate SendGrid for email notifications
- Use Pydantic models for validation
- Implement authentication and RBAC using FastAPI dependencies

### Assumptions Made
- All users will authenticate via company SSO
- Only internal users will access the API
- File uploads will not exceed 10MB per file

### Implementation Plan
1. Define Pydantic models for customer and file data
2. Implement CRUD endpoints in `src/api.py`
3. Add file upload/download endpoints
4. Integrate SendGrid for email notifications
5. Add authentication and RBAC
6. Write unit and integration tests

## Implementation Notes

### Step 1: Define Models
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: 2024-06-01
- **Notes**: Added `Customer` and `FileUpload` models to `src/models.py` with validation for required fields.

### Step 2: CRUD Endpoints
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Date**: 2024-06-02
- **Notes**: Implemented `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` endpoints. `PUT` endpoint pending. Tests written for `GET` and `POST`.

### Step 3: File Uploads
- **Status**: Pending
- **Date**: 
- **Notes**: Will use GCS for storage. Need to add file type validation.

## Testing & Validation

- [x] Unit tests written and passing
- [x] Integration tests written and passing
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed (if applicable)

### Test Results
- All unit and integration tests for customer CRUD pass (coverage: 95%)
- Manual file upload tests pending

## Documentation Updates

### Files Modified
- [x] `src/models.py` updated
- [x] `src/api.py` updated
- [x] Documentation files updated
- [ ] Configuration files updated

### New Files Created
- `src/email_utils.py` (for SendGrid integration)

## Deployment & Verification

### Deployment Status
- [x] Local development environment tested
- [ ] Staging environment deployed (if applicable)
- [ ] Production deployment completed
- [ ] Post-deployment verification completed

### Verification Results
- Local API endpoints tested with Postman
- File upload/download tested locally

## Completion Summary

### Request Fulfillment Status
- [ ] All requirements met
- [x] Partial requirements met (file upload pending)
- [ ] Requirements not met (explain why)

### Lessons Learned
- Early test writing helped catch validation bugs
- GCS integration was straightforward with existing utilities
- Need to clarify file size limits with stakeholders

### Next Steps
- Complete file upload implementation
- Deploy to staging and run end-to-end tests
- Update user documentation
